Hi, Welcome to SwacchSauchalaya. This is a cross platform webapp created using meteor js as frontend and mongo db as the database. We have used the metoer js boiler plate.

Note : To run meteor on a differnt host, use

ifconfig | grep inet
export ROOT_URL=http://192.168.2.2:3000


Please run meteor on the home folder of the app to run the project.
